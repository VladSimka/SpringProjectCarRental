# Car Rental System
The Car Rental System is a web application developed using Spring MVC, JSP, Spring Security, and Hibernate. It provides a user-friendly platform for car rental services, offering customers the ability to browse and select available cars, fill out order forms, make payments, and more. Administrators have access to additional features such as registering car returns, recording damages, issuing invoices, and managing rental requests.

# Features
Car browsing: Customers can view a list of available cars and their details, including model, make, and rental rates.
Order placement: Customers can fill out an order form, providing their passport information and desired rental duration.
Payment processing: Customers can make payments using a secure payment gateway.
Return registration: Administrators can register car returns, update the return date, and calculate rental charges.
Damage recording: Administrators can record any damages to the returned cars and evaluate the need for repairs.
Invoice generation: Administrators can issue invoices for repairs if necessary and manage the payment process.
Rental request management: Administrators can review rental requests, accept or reject them, and provide reasons for rejection.
User authentication and authorization: Spring Security is implemented to ensure secure access to the system, with different roles for customers and administrators.
